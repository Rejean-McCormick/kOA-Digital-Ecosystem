# Historical A014 — Orgo↔Konnaxion Runtime Validation Snapshot (2026-09-12)

**Status:** historical fixture — **outbound Orgo→Konnaxion publish validated; corrected inbound Konnaxion/eThikos→Orgo path still pending**
**Normative for kOA:** NO
**Secrets:** intentionally omitted

## Architecture correction (2026-09-12)

The original A014 fixture incorrectly modeled the decision authority/path as **UCKK/Assembly → Orgo**. The corrected architecture is:

```text
Konnaxion / eThikos
→ finalized decision
→ direct Konnaxion→Orgo handoff
→ Signal / Workflow / Case / Tasks
```

UCKK is an **optional publication/distribution surface**, not the decision authority and not a mandatory relay. Decisions for this flow are finalized in **Konnaxion/eThikos**.

The historical A014 identifiers remain useful for runtime traceability, but they are not acceptance evidence for the corrected inbound authority path.

---

## What is now validated

The historical fixture has validated useful runtime mechanics:

```text
T-14     PASS (historical fixture mechanics)
T-7      PASS (historical fixture mechanics)
T0-pre   PASS (historical fixture mechanics)
T0-post  PASS (historical fixture mechanics)
J3       PASS (historical fixture mechanics)
J30      PASS for outbound Orgo→Konnaxion transport/publication
```

Important distinction:

- the **outbound** path `Orgo → Konnaxion` is now validated end-to-end;
- the **corrected inbound** path `Konnaxion/eThikos → Orgo` has not yet been validated end-to-end;
- therefore the historical T0 authority path must still be refactored before the vertical slice can be called architecturally complete.

## Konnaxion runtime state

Validated local provider runtime:

```text
World                 uckk-a014
Release               r1 / world_release 1
World status          READY
Promoted release      CURRENT
Bridge listener       127.0.0.1:8011
Provider endpoint     /api/integrations/orgo/konnaxion/uckk-a014/publish/
```

The provider was confirmed healthy through its authenticated bridge runtime. The publish request returned HTTP 200 and the impact lookup returned HTTP 200.

---

## Orgo runtime state

Validated local Orgo runtime facts:

```text
PostgreSQL host       127.0.0.1
PostgreSQL port       5432
Database              orgo_test
Database user         orgo_test
Worker                active with Konnaxion bridge configuration
API                   alive on port 4000 during redrive
Application login     successful for orgo-e2e test account
```

Passwords, bearer tokens and full database URLs are intentionally not recorded here.

## J30 recovery and final result

The existing J30 operation was originally terminally failed because the provider was not configured:

```text
operation_id          6b8c5523-096e-4fc0-b6a9-be644240b497
provider              konnaxion
operation             publish
initial status        FAILED
initial error         PROVIDER_UNCONFIGURED
idempotency_key       uckk:A014:impact:J30:v1
correlation_id        corr.uckk.A014.D009
```

Associated historical outbox item:

```text
outbox_id             2def0f3a-f62c-4104-bb14-779d239d2237
initial status        DEAD
initial attempts      8
initial last_error    PROVIDER_UNCONFIGURED
aggregate_id          6b8c5523-096e-4fc0-b6a9-be644240b497
```

Recovery used the **canonical Orgo redrive API**, not SQL and not a duplicate J30 scenario request.

Observed redrive result:

```text
redrive               accepted
IntegrationOperation  RUNNING after ~2 s
IntegrationOperation  SUCCEEDED after ~4 s
```

This confirms the durable Orgo worker/provider path can recover a previously dead delivery after the provider is restored.

The outbox row itself was not separately re-read after success in this session; the confirmed acceptance evidence is the terminal `IntegrationOperation = SUCCEEDED` plus the provider-owned Konnaxion effect below.

---

## Konnaxion J30 Impact — exact-once evidence

The provider received the Orgo publish request:

```text
POST /api/integrations/orgo/konnaxion/uckk-a014/publish/ → 200
```

The verification lookup returned exactly one matching Impact:

```text
GET /api/integrations/orgo/konnaxion/uckk-a014/impacts/
  ?external_reference=impact:UCKK-A014:day30:v1
→ 200
count = 1
```

Confirmed business effect:

```text
impact id              1
external_reference     impact:UCKK-A014:day30:v1
status                 published
checkpoint             day_30
demo_id                uckk-pedagogy-pilot-a014
correlation_id         corr.uckk.A014.D009
published_at           2026-09-12T23:34:16.996048+00:00
receipt.status         succeeded
receipt.impact_id      1
receipt.published      true
receipt.synthetic      true
receipt.world_key      uckk-a014
receipt.world_release  1
receipt.artifact_type  impact_update
receipt.epistemic      synthetic_demo_fixture
```

Acceptance condition for the outbound path is satisfied:

```text
Orgo IntegrationOperation.status == SUCCEEDED
AND
Konnaxion Impact count == 1
AND
Konnaxion receipt.status == succeeded
```

Therefore:

> **Historical J30 outbound Orgo→Konnaxion publish = PASS.**

This proves the outbound bridge mechanics and idempotent business effect for this fixture. It does **not** prove the corrected inbound decision authority path.

---

## What remains before architectural completion

Do not treat the old UCKK/Assembly inbound path as the final architecture.

Resume in this order:

1. Define/confirm the finalized Konnaxion/eThikos DecisionRecord that authoritatively triggers operational work.
2. Implement/configure the direct authenticated **Konnaxion/eThikos → Orgo** machine handoff.
3. Remove UCKK/Assembly as a required decision authority or relay from the runtime scenario and fixtures. UCKK may remain as an optional publication/distribution consumer.
4. Re-run the inbound path and prove exactly one Orgo Signal/business consequence for a stable decision idempotency identity.
5. Revalidate Case/Task/workflow creation using the corrected decision source.
6. Re-run the outbound impact path from the corrected scenario and preserve the already validated `SUCCEEDED + exactly one Konnaxion effect` invariant.
7. Only then continue later follow-up/reconsideration checkpoints (historically named J90/R1).

No cross-system SQL mutation should be used.

## Authentication distinction

Database credentials and Orgo application credentials are separate concerns.

The canonical redrive was performed through the Orgo API using an application login. Database credentials are not application login credentials and must not be documented as such.

---

## Current completion gate

The corrected vertical slice is complete only when both directions are proven:

```text
Konnaxion/eThikos finalized DecisionRecord
→ direct authenticated Orgo handoff
→ expected Signal / Workflow / Case / Tasks
```

and:

```text
Orgo IntegrationOperation.status == SUCCEEDED
AND
exactly one Konnaxion provider-owned Impact exists
```

The second condition is now validated for the historical J30 fixture. The first condition remains the principal open architecture/integration task.
