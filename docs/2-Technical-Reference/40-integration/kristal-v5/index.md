# Kristal v5 integration

**External normative authority:** Kristal v5 specification  
**Pinned release:** `5.0.0-rc.1`

kOA does not duplicate Kristal schemas. It pins and references the Kristal release, then defines only ecosystem/deployment policy around those contracts.

## Core semantic changes from the old kOA model

- Structured Epistemic State is the primary structured input.
- Claim-IR and Resolved Claim-IR are optional profiles/intermediate artifacts, not a universal pipeline.
- Compilation may produce a Working Exchange before final validation/recognition.
- Validation, certainty and authority recognition are independent axes.
- Reference Exchange means recognized reference under declared authority/scope, not universal truth.
- Runtime Packs preserve `source_artifact_status` and Reader Policy metadata.
- Validation must not be treated as a universal compile blocker.
