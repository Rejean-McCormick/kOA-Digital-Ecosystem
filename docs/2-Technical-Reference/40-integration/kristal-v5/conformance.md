# Kristal v5 conformance for kOA

A kOA integration claiming Kristal v5 alignment must demonstrate at least:

1. exact version/tag/commit/canonicalization pin verification;
2. Structured Epistemic State support at the Kristal boundary;
3. no assumption that Claim-IR is universally required;
4. separate compile/validation/recognition/publication/activation status;
5. no universal `no compile on fail` rule;
6. preservation of Working versus Reference status;
7. Runtime Pack `source_artifact_status` preservation;
8. Reader Policy and Query Contract compatibility handling;
9. authority-recognition metadata kept distinct from signatures and validation;
10. deployment activation delegated to exactly one owner;
11. rollback/downgrade/revocation checks applied by the activation owner according to policy;
12. no kOA extension silently changes Kristal identity or epistemic semantics.

A stricter kOA production profile may block reference publication or activation after failed/insufficient validation. Such a gate must be identified as a profile/deployment policy, not a Kristal core rule.
