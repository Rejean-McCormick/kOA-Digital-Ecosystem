# kOA Layer Model

**File:** `docs/3-Layer-Model/LAYER_MODEL.md`  
**Status:** Conceptual orientation  
**Normative for kOA:** NO  
**External normative reference:** None  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **kOA Layer Model**: a conceptual map of the functional layers that make the broader kOA architecture readable.

It explains how kOA moves from:

```text
meaning → knowledge → decision → action → memory → future capacity
```
This file does **not** replace the technical Digital Ecosystem documentation. It does not define schemas, contracts, node interfaces, runtime gates, Kristal artifact formats, or operational procedures.

The technical Digital Ecosystem documentation remains the authority for:

* system architecture;
* node responsibilities;
* kOA-owned artifacts;
* operational workflows;
* trust boundaries;
* determinism;
* pipeline behavior;
* release, rollback, and failure procedures.

This layer model is a **conceptual map**. It helps humans understand the whole system before entering the technical documentation.

---

## 2. Core thesis

kOA is an architecture of passages.

It helps a group move through the full cycle of collective capacity:

```text
sense-making
→ knowledge structuring
→ deliberation
→ decision
→ execution
→ memory
→ learning
→ transmission
```

The central claim is:

> kOA does not only store knowledge or coordinate tasks. It structures the passages between meaning, knowledge, judgment, action, memory, and future collective capacity.

---

## 3. Core flow

The simplest flow is:

```text
Meaning → Knowledge → Decision → Action → Memory → Capacity
```

Expanded:

```text
raw inputs
→ interpreted meaning
→ structured knowledge
→ validated canon
→ deliberation
→ legitimate decision
→ operational execution
→ memory
→ learning
→ future capacity
```

This corresponds to the public kOA cycle:

```text
Know → Choose → Act → Remember
```

Where:

* **Know** means gathering, structuring, validating, and preserving knowledge.
* **Choose** means deliberating, comparing options, and making decisions legible.
* **Act** means converting decisions into tasks, responsibilities, workflows, and execution.
* **Remember** means preserving results, errors, lessons, and updated knowledge for the next cycle.

## 4. Relation to the technical Digital Ecosystem

The technical Digital Ecosystem already defines a contract-driven operational spine:

```text
Ingest
→ Extract
→ Resolve
→ Validate
→ Compile
→ Distribute
→ Render
→ Execute
→ Feedback
```

The layer model sits above that spine.

It explains the broader human, semantic, institutional, and strategic functions around the technical pipeline.

Approximate mapping:

| Layer model              | Technical spine                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Orientation / mandate    | mandate bundle, control-plane constraints   |
| Provenance / ingestion   | ingest, extract                             |
| Semantics / meaning      | resolve, reconcile, render meaning          |
| Structured knowledge     | Kristal bridge, canonical artifacts         |
| Validation / canon       | validate, compile, conformance gates        |
| Deliberation             | Konnaxion / ethiKos-facing state            |
| Decision / legitimacy    | EkoH, Smart Vote, decision records          |
| Execution                | Orgo, SwarmCraft, runtime behavior          |
| Memory / learning        | feedback, logs, archives, updated artifacts |
| Resilience / autonomy    | offline behavior, rollback, determinism     |
| Learning / interface     | UCKK, guides, user-facing pathways          |
| Narrative / adoption     | King Klown, Kin City, public pedagogy       |
| Deployment / translation | pilots, partners, external vocabulary       |

This mapping is approximate. The technical documentation remains authoritative for implementation details.

## 5. Layer stack

The kOA Layer Model has fourteen layers.

```text
0. Separation of functions
1. Orientation / mandate
2. Semantics / meaning
3. Provenance / ingestion
4. Structured knowledge
5. Validation / canon
6. Deliberation
7. Decision / legitimacy
8. Execution
9. Memory / learning
10. Resilience / autonomy
11. Learning / interface
12. Narrative / adoption
13. Deployment / translation
```

These layers are not isolated modules. They are functional zones.

A single technical component may participate in several layers. A single layer may involve several components.

---

## 6. Layer 0 — Separation of functions

### Function

## 20. Layer relationships

The layers are directional but not strictly linear.

The common forward path is:

```text
orientation
→ semantics
→ provenance
→ structured knowledge
→ validation
→ deliberation
→ decision
→ execution
→ memory
```

The learning loop is:

```text
memory
→ updated knowledge
→ better deliberation
→ better decisions
→ better action
```

The adoption loop is:

```text
interface
→ learning
→ narrative
→ participation
→ deployment
→ feedback
→ memory
```

The resilience loop is:

```text
validated artifacts
→ portable runtime
→ local execution
→ audit
→ rollback
→ corrected release
```

---

## 21. Layer model vs. technical implementation

The layer model should not be read as a directory map, class diagram, schema map, or node map.

It is a conceptual architecture.

For implementation, consult the technical Digital Ecosystem documentation.

Layer model:

```text
What function does this part of the system serve?
```

Technical docs:

```text
What component, artifact, node, schema, or process implements it?
```

Both are needed.

The layer model makes kOA understandable.

The technical docs make kOA buildable, testable, and operable.

---

## 22. Non-goals

This file does not:

* define Kristal schemas;
* restate Kristal contracts;
* define JSON field lists;
* define canonicalization rules;
* replace technical node documentation;
* define operational runbooks;
* define partner strategy in detail;
* define UCKK curriculum;
* define narrative canon;
* define certification policy.

Those belong in their own documentation sets.

---

## 23. One-page summary

kOA is a layered architecture for collective capacity.

It separates functions, orients action, clarifies meaning, captures provenance, structures knowledge, validates canon, organizes deliberation, makes decisions legible, executes responsibilities, preserves memory, protects resilience, teaches participation, supports narrative adoption, and translates itself for deployment.

In short:

> kOA is an architecture of passages: from meaning to knowledge, from knowledge to decision, from decision to action, from action to memory, and from memory to future collective capacity.
