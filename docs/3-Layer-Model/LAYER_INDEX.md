# kOA Layer Index

**File:** `docs/3-Layer-Model/LAYER_INDEX.md`  
**Status:** Conceptual orientation  
**Normative for kOA:** NO  
**External normative references:** None

---

## 1. Purpose

This file indexes the functional layers of the broader kOA architecture.

The layer model does not replace the kOA Digital Ecosystem technical documentation. It provides a conceptual map of how the system moves from orientation and meaning to knowledge, decision, action, memory, learning, narrative adoption, and deployment translation.

The technical documentation remains responsible for system architecture, node responsibilities, kOA-owned artifacts, operational workflows, trust boundaries, determinism, and integration constraints.

## 2. Core Flow

```text
Meaning → Knowledge → Decision → Action → Memory → Capacity
```
Expanded:

```text
Orientation
→ Semantics
→ Provenance
→ Structured Knowledge
→ Validation
→ Deliberation
→ Decision
→ Execution
→ Memory
→ Resilience
→ Learning
→ Narrative
→ Deployment Translation
```

Canonical kOA cycle:

```text
Know → Choose → Act → Remember
```

## 4. Layer Groups

The layers can be read in four groups.

### A. Foundation Layers

```text
0. Separation of Functions
1. Orientation / Mandate
2. Semantics / Meaning
3. Provenance / Ingestion
```

These layers define what the system is, why it acts, what its terms mean, and where its inputs come from.

Without these layers, the system becomes ambiguous, ungrounded, or vulnerable to hidden capture.

### B. Knowledge and Legitimacy Layers

```text
4. Structured Knowledge
5. Validation / Canon
6. Deliberation
7. Decision / Legitimacy
```

These layers transform input into knowledge, knowledge into public reasoning, and public reasoning into legitimate choices.

Without these layers, information remains scattered, decisions become opaque, and expertise can become either invisible or authoritarian.

### C. Action and Memory Layers

```text
8. Execution
9. Memory / Learning
10. Resilience / Autonomy
```

These layers convert choices into action, action into learning, and learning into durable capacity.

Without these layers, the system remains performative: people discuss, decide, and announce, but do not reliably execute, remember, or improve.

### D. Transmission and Adoption Layers

```text
11. Learning / Interface
12. Narrative / Adoption
13. Deployment / Translation
```

These layers make the system teachable, usable, memorable, and translatable for real communities, partners, and institutions.

Without these layers, the architecture remains technically coherent but socially inaccessible.

---

## 5. Layer Dependencies

Each layer depends on the layers below it.

```text
Deployment depends on adoption.
Adoption depends on interface and learning.
Learning depends on memory.
Memory depends on execution.
Execution depends on decision.
Decision depends on deliberation.
Deliberation depends on validated knowledge.
Validated knowledge depends on structured knowledge.
Structured knowledge depends on provenance.
Provenance depends on semantic clarity.
Semantic clarity depends on orientation.
Orientation depends on separation of functions.
```

In short:

```text
No orientation → no coherent meaning.
No meaning → no reliable knowledge.
No knowledge → no grounded decision.
No decision → no legitimate execution.
No execution → no real action.
No memory → no learning.
No learning → no transmission.
No transmission → no durable collective capacity.
```

## 6. Relation to the kOA Digital Ecosystem Pipeline

The technical kOA Digital Ecosystem pipeline can be summarized as:

```text
Ingest → Extract → Resolve → Validate → Compile → Distribute → Render → Execute → Feedback
```

The layer model is broader. It includes the technical pipeline, but also includes institutional, semantic, learning, narrative, and deployment layers.

Approximate mapping:

| Layer Model              | Digital Ecosystem Relation                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Orientation / Mandate    | Keter / mandate inputs / operating constraints                   |
| Semantics / Meaning      | semantic resolution, mappings, definitions, ambiguity handling   |
| Provenance / Ingestion   | source capture, inputs, snapshots, traceability                  |
| Structured Knowledge     | Kristal-adjacent knowledge artifacts and structured outputs      |
| Validation / Canon       | conformance, gates, canonical releases, fail-closed behavior     |
| Deliberation             | Konnaxion / ethiKos / structured public reasoning                |
| Decision / Legitimacy    | EkoH / Smart Vote / transparent decision readings                |
| Execution                | Orgo / SwarmCraft / task and workflow execution                  |
| Memory / Learning        | feedback, logs, archives, updated artifacts, post-cycle learning |
| Resilience / Autonomy    | offline operation, deterministic behavior, rollback, portability |
| Learning / Interface     | UCKK, courses, guides, user-facing interfaces                    |
| Narrative / Adoption     | King Klown, Kin City, public pedagogy, symbolic interface        |
| Deployment / Translation | partner-facing explanations, pilots, adoption pathways           |

## 7. One-Sentence Definitions

### Layer 0 — Separation of Functions

Separates the major functions of kOA so that movement, school, infrastructure, narrative, ethics, legitimacy, and memory do not collapse into one authority.

### Layer 1 — Orientation / Mandate

Defines why the system acts, what it is allowed to do, and what principles constrain it.

### Layer 2 — Semantics / Meaning

Makes meaning explicit by clarifying words, categories, definitions, relationships, and ambiguities.

### Layer 3 — Provenance / Ingestion

Captures input with enough context and traceability for later verification, comparison, and reuse.

### Layer 4 — Structured Knowledge

Transforms inputs into reusable, verifiable knowledge artifacts.

### Layer 5 — Validation / Canon

Determines what can be stabilized, released, or treated as canonical without hidden mutation.

### Layer 6 — Deliberation

Turns disagreement, contribution, and consultation into structured public reasoning.

### Layer 7 — Decision / Legitimacy

Turns deliberation into transparent, contestable, multi-readable choices.

### Layer 8 — Execution

Turns decisions into tasks, responsibilities, workflows, and follow-through.

### Layer 9 — Memory / Learning

Turns action and feedback into institutional memory and improved future capacity.

### Layer 10 — Resilience / Autonomy

Ensures the system can remain portable, deterministic, recoverable, and usable under constraint.

### Layer 11 — Learning / Interface

Makes the system teachable and usable through learning paths, guides, interfaces, and UCKK.

### Layer 12 — Narrative / Adoption

Makes the system memorable and publicly transmissible through narrative, symbolic interface, and public pedagogy.

### Layer 13 — Deployment / Translation

Translates the layer model into partner-facing, pilot-facing, and institution-facing language.

The layer model can be translated into recognized external vocabularies.

## 9. Intended Use

Use this index to:

1. navigate the layer files;
2. keep layer definitions consistent;
3. explain kOA without collapsing everything into one module;
4. translate internal kOA vocabulary into external language;
5. identify which layer matters for a given partner, pilot, or technical document.

This index is not a technical contract. It is a conceptual navigation document.

---

## 10. Maintenance Rule

When a new layer is added, renamed, merged, or removed:

1. update this file;
2. update `LAYER_MODEL.md`;
3. update the corresponding file under `layers/`;
4. verify that no technical contract in the Digital Ecosystem docs is duplicated or contradicted.

Layer documentation must explain the architecture without redefining technical schemas, artifact formats, or normative Kristal contracts.
