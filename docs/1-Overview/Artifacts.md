# Ecosystem artifacts

Artifacts remain authoritative at their owning system/component.

| Family | Owner | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Civic/governance | Konnaxion | DecisionRecord, consultations, readings |
| Operational/work | Orgo | Signal, WorkflowVersion, Case, Task, IntegrationOperation |
| Acquisition evidence | EncyKlopedia | source/provider evidence, immutable harvest handoff, referent candidates |
| Epistemic/reference | Kristal | Referent Registry entries, Structured Epistemic State, Working/Reference Exchange, Validation Report, Authority Recognition, Reader Policy, Runtime Pack manifest |
| Consumer projection | UCKK / Univers-Cité | scope/view configuration, Moodle materialization, derived glossary/media presentation |
| Platform release | kOA-Linux | Release Set, registered release-channel/artifact contracts, lifecycle receipts |
| Runtime Pack local state | `kristal_runtime` | verification record, active Runtime Pack record, activation/rollback receipts, runtime health |
| Privileged node lifecycle | kOA Node Agent | privileged-operation/activation/recovery receipts |
| Presentation | Koali Spaces | Space definition, runtime registration, surface descriptors, Space lifecycle state |
| Cross-system reference | source + adopted contract | ArtifactRef, ExportManifest or equivalent source-owned references |
| Ecosystem build evidence | kOA integration layer | Build Record as non-authoritative correlation/reproducibility evidence |

## Authority-preserving knowledge layers

```text
1. Acquisition evidence
   source/provider-owned facts + EncyKlopedia immutable handoff
       ↓
2. Kristal epistemic artifacts
   referents, assertions, validation/recognition, Working/Reference artifacts
       ↓
3a. Runtime/query materialization
    Runtime Pack / derived indexes / read models

3b. Consumer projection
    UCKK / Moodle / glossary / media presentation
```

Layers 3a/3b are derived and rebuildable. Neither becomes a second source of epistemic truth.

## Operational source state

Mutable product state remains product-owned. When knowledge is derived from it, the boundary uses an immutable source export/evidence reference with provenance rather than dual-writing the same record into Kristal.

## Release and activation

The **kOA-Linux Release Set** is the platform compatibility artifact. Active Runtime Pack state is owned by `kristal_runtime`; privileged host transitions may be executed by kOA Node Agent where required. Digital Ecosystem defines no parallel release or activation authority.
