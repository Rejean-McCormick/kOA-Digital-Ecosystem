# Ecosystem artifacts

Artifacts remain authoritative at their owning system/component.

| Family | Owner | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Civic/governance | Konnaxion | DecisionRecord, consultations, readings |
| Operational/work | Orgo | Signal, WorkflowVersion, Case, Task, IntegrationOperation |
| Epistemic/reference | Kristal | Structured Epistemic State, Working Exchange, Validation Report, Authority Recognition, Reference Exchange, Reader Policy, Runtime Pack manifest |
| Platform release | kOA-Linux | Release Set; registered channel/artifact contracts; lifecycle receipts |
| Runtime Pack local state | `kristal_runtime` | verification record, active Runtime Pack record, activation/rollback receipts, runtime health |
| Privileged node lifecycle | kOA Node Agent | privileged-operation/activation/recovery receipts under its contract |
| Presentation | Koali Spaces | Space definition, presentation/runtime registration, surface descriptors and Space lifecycle state |
| Cross-system reference | source + adopted integration contract | ArtifactRef, ExportManifest or equivalent source-owned references |
| Ecosystem build evidence | kOA integration layer | Build Record, when used as non-authoritative correlation/reproducibility evidence |

## Release Set

Digital Ecosystem uses the **kOA-Linux Release Set** as the platform release compatibility artifact rather than inventing a competing Release Record authority. Release Sets bind tested-compatible versions across independent `system`, `services`, `governance` and `knowledge` channels.

## Runtime Pack activation state

Digital Ecosystem does **not** define a new authoritative Runtime Activation State for kOA-Linux. The active Runtime Pack state is owned by `kristal_runtime`; privileged node operations can be executed by kOA Node Agent where the active profile requires them.
